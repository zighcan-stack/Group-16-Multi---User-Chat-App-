💬 Multi-User Chat App
📖 Project Summary

Python Multi-User Chat App is a real-time chatroom built with Python 3.10+ that allows users on the same local network to connect, choose usernames, and exchange messages instantly.
The system is structured with separate classes for the server and clients, includes custom exceptions for network errors, and provides a simple Tkinter GUI foe flexibility. This implementation showcases professional practices including modular design, clean architecture, and automated testing with pytest.

 Features

👥 Multi-User Chatroom: Many clients can connect simultaneously

🖥️ GUI Client: Tkinter-based chat interface with user list

💻 Console Client: Lightweight terminal version for quick use

🕒 Timestamps: Every message is time-stamped for clarity

🗒️ User List Sync: Real-time updates of connected users

🚫 Duplicate Username Protection: Prevents collisions

⚡ Threaded Server: Handles multiple clients concurrently

🛠️ Cross-Platform: Works on Windows, macOS, Linux

👥 Team Collaboration

Development is organized through GitHub with clear role assignments:

Networking Team → Implement the socket-based server and client communication

GUI Team → Design and polish the Tkinter-based interface

Testing Team → Write unit tests and document network procedures

Docs/Media Team → Prepare README files, reports, and demo videos

Coordinator → Oversee integration, consistency, and submission

🎯 Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

To achieve the MVP, we will deliver:

A functioning server that accepts multiple clients, broadcasts messages, and handles disconnects gracefully.

A basic Tkinter client GUI supporting usernames, real-time chat, user lists, and timestamps.

A test suite verifying network stability and error handling, ensuring a reliable, minimal chatroom experience.
